# Quiz Builder App

## Overview

The Quiz Builder App empowers you to create personalized quizzes from scratch. Whether you're a teacher, trainer, or quiz enthusiast, this application provides an intuitive interface for crafting and managing quizzes tailored to your needs.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend

- **React:** A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Chakra UI:** A simple component library for building accessible and customizable React applications.
- **Typescript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enhancing code quality and developer productivity.
- **React Query:** A library for managing, caching, and updating server state in React applications.

### Backend (Current Implementation)

- **Client-Side Storage (localStorage):** The backend of the Quiz Builder App currently utilizes `localStorage` for storing quiz data on the client side. This approach is suitable for small-scale applications and simplifies the setup process.

## Getting Started

To set up the Quiz Builder app on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-builder.git
   cd quiz-builder
   In the project directory, you can run:
   ```

#####`npm install`

Run the App: #####`npm run dev`

Preview the App: #####`npm run preview`

Build for Production: #####`npm run build`

###Future Plans
The Quiz Builder App is currently in its early stages, utilizing client-side storage for simplicity. However, we plan to migrate to a more robust backend architecture using Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL in the next development phase. This transition will provide enhanced scalability, security, and data management capabilities.
